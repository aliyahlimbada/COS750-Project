                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>formal definition</b> and structure of the Composite design pattern.</li>
                    <li>The distinct roles of the <b>Component, Leaf, and Composite</b> elements.</li>
                    <li>The conceptual difference between <b>Aggregation and Composition</b> in UML and their impact on object lifetime.</li>
